Welcome to Code by Night ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Shivam â€” I'm a growth marketer turned data scientist and now pushing to become a machine learning engineer.

This blog is my learning journal as I dive deep into machine learning, programming & buiding things from scratch - no CS degree, no fancy bootcamp, just an itch to build & figure things out.

Here, I document what I learn, what I struggle with, and what finally clicks.

If you're getting into tech you donâ€™t have to go through it alone, I'm happy to stumble alongside you and "figure it out".

Letâ€™s build, learn, and ship.
