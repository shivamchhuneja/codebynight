Welcome to Swift by Night ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Shivam â€” learning iOS development one late-night build at a time.

This blog is my learning journal as I dive deep into Swift, SwiftUI, CoreML, animations, and building real apps from scratch â€” no CS degree, no fancy bootcamp, just an itch to build & figure things out.

If you're a self-taught developer, a curious builder, or someone starting "late" â€” you're in the right place.

Here, I document what I learn, what I struggle with, and what finally clicks.

If you're getting into tech you donâ€™t have to go through it alone, I'm happy to stumble alongside you and "figure it out".

Letâ€™s build, learn, and ship.
