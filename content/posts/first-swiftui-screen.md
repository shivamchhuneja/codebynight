Tonight I built my first SwiftUI screen — a basic login page with text fields and a button.

Here's what I learned:
- How to use `VStack` and `Spacer` to structure layout
- That `.padding()` is my best friend
- Previewing in Xcode makes iteration so much easier

Tomorrow, I’ll try adding some interactivity using `@State` and maybe validate the form.
