Today wasnâ€™t a big coding day, but it was a good learning day.

## Why I Picked an Advanced Go Book

So hereâ€™s the thing - Iâ€™ve started reading **Concurrency in Go** by Catherine Buday.

Yup, a pretty advanced book for someone whoâ€™s still new to the language.

But honestly? Itâ€™s working really well for me. If I stuck to just `for` loops and `if` statements all day, Iâ€™d get bored fast. Iâ€™m not a total beginner in tech - Iâ€™ve been working with engineers and devs closely for a while - so this stuff doesnâ€™t feel completely alien.

Hereâ€™s what I went through today:

- Race conditions
- Atomicity
- Memory access and synchronization
- Deadlocks
- (Next up: live locks and starvation)

Itâ€™s weirdly fun. Like Iâ€™m finally getting to peek behind the curtain.

## Reorganizing My Go Project Structure

The other thing I did today was restructure my Go project.

Iâ€™m doing a Udemy course by Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller, and he starts a fresh project for every lecture. But I wanted a single repo where I could organize everything cleanly.

That meant:

- Breaking out separate packages
- Exporting functions properly
- Importing and referencing them cleanly
- Making things modular and easy to maintain

Took some trial and error, a bit of help from ChatGPT (like youâ€™d use Stack Overflow), and a couple of YouTube videos. But I finally feel like I understand how Go projects should be structured.

Hereâ€™s what it looks like right now:

```go
Go/
â”œâ”€â”€ calculators/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ bank.go
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ investment_calculator.go
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ profit_calculator.go
â”œâ”€â”€ helpers/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ utils.go
â”œâ”€â”€ pointers/
â”œâ”€â”€ structs/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ structs.go
â”œâ”€â”€ go.mod
â””â”€â”€ main.go
```

Nothing fancy. But itâ€™s mine, and itâ€™s working.

## A Quick Snippet

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
    "github.com/shivamchhuneja/learning-go/calculators"
)

func main() {
    runApp()
}

func runApp() {
    var option int

    fmt.Println("Select the calculator")
    fmt.Println("1. Investment Calculator")
    fmt.Println("2. Profit Calculator")
    fmt.Println("3. Bank Service")
    fmt.Println("4. Exit")
    fmt.Print("Your choice: ")

    fmt.Scan(&option)

    switch option {
    case 1:
        calculators.InvestmentCalculator()
    case 2:
        calculators.ProfitCalculator()
    case 3:
        calculators.BankingMode()
    case 4:
        fmt.Println("Exiting now...")
        os.Exit(0)
    default:
        fmt.Println("Try again")
        runApp()
    }
}
```

## Thatâ€™s All For Today

Didnâ€™t write a ton of code, but I walked away with:

- A better grasp on Go project structure
- A stronger mental model of concurrency
- And a cleaner, more usable repo

**Not bad for Day 3.**
