description: "A short, honest reflection on finally understanding pointers in Go — a concept that I picked up after a decade."

Today was Day 2 of learning Go, and to be honest, I didn’t have much time to dedicate. But I still wanted to make some progress.

So I wrapped up the **Pointers** module from Maximilian Schwarzmüller’s [Go: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/go-the-complete-guide/) course — and for the first time in my life, I feel like pointers _actually_ make sense to me.

## 10 Years Too Late

Back in college, I studied C++ as part of my Electronics Engineering degree. And I’ll be real: pointers felt like dark magic.

I didn’t get them.

I didn’t even _want_ to get them after a while — that’s how frustrating they were.

Throw in a few lectures on assembly programming and the 8085 microprocessor, and I was already convinced coding wasn’t for me.

## But Today? It Clicked.

Fast forward 10 years, and here I am - revisiting pointers in Go. The course explained it clearly, but more than that, I think _I_ was just ready to understand it now.

Here’s what I practiced today:

- Creating and referencing pointers
- Dereferencing values
- Using pointers as function arguments
- Mutating data with pointers

Nothing fancy. Just the basics.

## Why This Feels Big

It’s not about how much I built today - it’s about how much I _learned_.

Understanding pointers used to feel like a gatekeeping concept. Like something you either “got” or you didn’t. But turns out, it just needed the right time, the right mindset, and the right explanation.

And now that it’s clicked, I can’t wait to build on this tomorrow.
