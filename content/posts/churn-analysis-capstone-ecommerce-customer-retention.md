description: "An in-depth walkthrough of my churn analysis capstone project: from data exploration and clustering to actionable insights for customer retention in a competitive e-commerce landscape."

Customer churn isn’t just a marketing problem - it’s a business survival issue. In competitive industries like e-commerce, losing one customer often means losing several revenue streams, especially when one account can represent multiple users.

This post is a breakdown of my churn prediction capstone project for the postgraduate data science program at UT Austin - also tied to my master's in data science at Deakin U. The project was closed-source, so I can't release the full notebook, but I’ll walk you through everything I did including code snippets, results, charts, what I learned, and where this project fits in my larger journey into machine learning and MLOps.

## 🧩 The Problem: Why Churn Matters So Much

The e-commerce company in question faced intense competitive pressure and a rising churn rate. Each lost account didn’t just represent a single user - it impacted groups of customers. That meant multiplicative revenue loss.

Our goals were:

- Predict churn at the account level
- Identify top drivers of churn
- Segment customers for targeted retention
- Recommend cost-effective, revenue-positive strategies

## 🧪 Dataset Overview & Initial Processing

The dataset had ~11,000 rows and 19 columns, combining both categorical and numerical variables. A few key points:

- Heavy class imbalance: Only ~17% of the accounts had churned
- Several columns had missing values which were handled via KNN imputation
- Mix of behavioral data (logins, payments, complaints), service scores, and engagement metrics

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key univariate and bivariate findings:

- **Device Used**: Desktop users churned more (~20%) than mobile (~16%)
- **Revenue Patterns**: Lower revenue/month was linked to higher churn
- **Complaints**: Past complaints were strongly correlated with churn
- **Tenure**: Shorter tenure customers churned more
- **Payment Method**: Debit and UPI users churned more than Credit Card users

Interestingly, some expected predictors (like cashback or service score) didn’t show strong correlation individually - indicating multi-factorial churn behavior.

## 📊 Clustering for Segmentation

Rather than just modeling churn, we wanted actionable segmentation. Using the elbow method and KMeans, we identified 4 customer clusters.

Each cluster showed different churn profiles, behavior patterns, and required tailored business strategies.

## 📌 Cluster Highlights & Strategic Takeaways

![Churn Rate by Cluster](/images/blog/churn_rate_by_cluster.png)

### **Cluster 1** – Large Segment, High Churn (~20%)

- Male-dominated, married, mobile-first
- Mid-to-high revenue, but frequent complaints
- **Strategy**: Premium customer care, non-discount loyalty programs, debit-card reward partnerships

### **Cluster 3** – Smallest, but Worst Churn (~21%)

- Newer users with high cashback dependency
- Low service scores, high complaints, revenue decline
- **Strategy**: Early engagement triggers, reduce cashback reliance, introduce tiered perks

### **Cluster 0** – Mid-Tier Churn (~13%)

- HNI and Super users, higher spenders
- Credit card and UPI users, moderate complaints
- **Strategy**: VIP retention plans, gamified reward systems, re-engagement emails

### **Cluster 2** – Best Segment (~5% Churn)

- Long-tenure, high-revenue customers
- Highest satisfaction, lowest complaints
- **Strategy**: Just keep them happy! Introduce premium perks and incentivize digital payments

## 🤖 ML Model Evaluation & Results

This wasn’t just a segmentation project - I evaluated 6 different machine learning models for churn prediction:

| Model         | Test Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | AUC-ROC | Overfitting |
| ------------- | ------------- | --------- | ------ | -------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Decision Tree | 0.9312        | 0.7732    | 0.8364 | 0.8035   | 0.8934  | Yes         |
| Random Forest | 0.9742        | 0.9397    | 0.9050 | 0.9220   | 0.9936  | No          |
| XGBoost       | 0.9694        | 0.9189    | 0.8971 | 0.9079   | 0.9908  | No          |
| AdaBoost      | 0.8708        | 0.5957    | 0.7230 | 0.6532   | 0.9025  | Yes         |
| Naïve Bayes   | 0.7127        | 0.3386    | 0.7414 | 0.4648   | 0.7770  | No          |
| SVM           | 0.7744        | 0.4122    | 0.7995 | 0.5440   | 0.8526  | No          |
| Tuned RF      | 0.9765        | 0.9822    | 0.8760 | 0.9261   | 0.9960  | No          |

- Random Forest & XGBoost were the top performers with high precision and AUC scores, and no signs of overfitting, so I ended up tuning the random forest further.

- I also experimented with SMOTE for handling class imbalance, but performance dropped significantly across models so oversampling isn’t always the solution.

## 🔍 Feature Importance (XGBoost)

Top predictors of churn from the model:

- Tenure and Complaints were the most influential features.
- Other strong indicators: customer care interaction history, cashback dependency, and service score.

## 🎯 Business Outcomes & Learnings

This wasn’t just a modeling exercise - it was a strategy recommendation engine.

Key takeaways:

- **Churn is complex**: No one variable dominates, but multiple small signals do.
- **Clustering works**: It lets us build segment-specific retention tactics.
- **Complaints matter**: Past complaints + low satisfaction are gold for early churn signals.
- **Cashback ≠ loyalty**: High discount reliance often signals at-risk behavior.

## 🚀 What’s Next?

This project helped me:

- Think beyond models and into business strategy
- Practice handling imbalanced data
- Understand how to build insights\*with both EDA and clustering

It’s part of a broader set of real-world projects I’ll be tackling throughout my second year of the master's program - with more blogs and eventually open-sourced templates (when possible).

If you're interested in just nerding out - feel free to connect or drop a note.
